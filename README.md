# League of Legends Highlights Manager

*Note: This app is currently in development and has not yet been released.*

## Overview

The League of Legends Highlights Manager is a specialized application designed exclusively for **League of Legends** players. Unlike general-purpose tools like Outplayed and Medal.gg, this app focuses solely on providing the best experience for LoL enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Automatic Capture and Organization**: The app automatically captures all your gameplay highlights, so you never have to manually sift through replays or worry about missing your best plays.
- **Indexed Key Moments**: Key events such as kills, item purchases, champion matchups, team gold differences, and damage dealt are automatically indexed for easy access.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Easily search for specific moments, like an Akali pentakill or a game where you achieved 20 kills with Jinx.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Filter and sort replays based on your preferences, and assign weights to different types of plays to prioritize what matters most to you.

## Future Plans

- **Web Platform**: Develop a website where players can view plays featuring specific champion matchups at certain levels with particular items or runes.
- **Curated Montages**: Enjoy curated montages like Akali grandmaster highlights compiled from various players.
- **Enhanced Play Analysis**: Utilize match data to better determine what makes a play bad, good, or great, helping players learn and improve.

## Getting Started

This section will be updated once the app is ready for release.
